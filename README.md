# ISAFinalProject
This program was made for the final CSS3 Computer Architecture and Assembly Language at Hartnell College. This program creates an ISA by using two main components, an assembler and simulator. The assembler code can be found in "ProjecttestCSS3.cpp" and the simulator code can be found in "projectTestSimulator.cpp". The instruction file in which the instructions and opcodes are entered can be found in "projectTestInput.txt". The assembler converts the instructions and opcodes found in "projectTestInput.txt" and outputs the result into "projectTestOutput.txt" into binary, in which the simulator will read and execute the file. A complete description and requirements of this final can be found in the final project prompt "isa-project-css3.pdf".

The following opcode declarations are the possible opcode instructions as defined in ProjecttestCSS3.cpp
Any unknown opcode entered will result in an error.

string banana = "🍌"; //Hardcode input

string coconut = "🥥"; //User-Input

string grape = "🍇"; //Division

string strawberry = "🍓"; //Addition

string eggplant = "🍆"; //Subtraction

string pineapple = "🍍"; //Allocate array and input values

string lemon = "🍋" ; //Output

string apple = "🍎"; //Multiplication

string kiwi = "🥝"; //User Input

string repeat = "🔁"; //Allocate array and display sum

string clear = "✖️"; //Clear registers

string halt = "🚫"; //Halt

string potato = "🥔"; // Array Num Search
