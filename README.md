# ISAFinalProject
This program was made for the final CSS3 Computer Architecture and Assembly Language at Hartnell College. This program simulates an ISA assembler and simulator using emojis as the instruction set. The assembler code can be found in "ProjecttestCSS3.cpp" and the simulator code can be found in "projectTestSimulator.cpp". A complete description and requirements of this final can be found in the final project prompt titled isa-project-css3.pdf.

The following opcode declarations are the possible opcode instructions as defined in ProjecttestCSS3.cpp
Any unknown opcode entered will result in an error.

string banana = "🍌"; //Hardcode input

string coconut = "🥥"; //User-Input

string grape = "🍇"; //Division
